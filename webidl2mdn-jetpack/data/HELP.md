# Usage

Create MDN API Reference Skeletons by visiting raw WebIDL files

Here's where to find some if you don't have your own

* https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/webidl/
* https://gist.github.com/search?l=webidl&q=.webidl

Click the `Raw` link or button after you visit a WebIDL file.

A new browser tab will open to show you what MDN API pages can be created from given file.

# Bug reporting

If you don't
[find an issue](https://github.com/anaran/webidl2mdn/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+error)
reported, you can report a [new issue](https://github.com/anaran/webidl2mdn/issues).

# Limitations

Most likely you will get a bold red error message and a clickable notification you can use
to open an issue,
since webidl2 does not understand the pecularities of Mozilla WebIDL.

See
[Different dialects of WebIDL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Write_an_API_reference/Information_contained_in_a_WebIDL_file#Different_dialects_of_WebIDL)
.

Don't open an issue unless you have tried the following tips.

See

for changes I had to make to get

to parse and generate skeletons.

I hope to get access to improved webidl2 sources soon that will be able to parse Mozilla WebIDL files.
